            <p class="paragraph">     Pediatric Cancer is the deadliest disease in the U.S., killing almost 1,780 children anually. 
                    Over 20% of children diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. do not survive, and pediatric cancers tend to be
                    more agressive and deadly than those experienced by adults.
