            <p class="paragraph">     Pediatric Cancer is the deadliest disease in the U.S., killing almost 1,780 children anually. 
                    Over 20% of children diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. do not survive, and pediatric cancers tend to be
                    more agressive and deadly than those experienced by adults.

                <h1>A Coordinated Research Effort</h1>
                <p class="paragraph">    In children ages 0 to 19, the most common cancers are often much more deadly
                    than the avarage adult cancer, and as such, more research is required to find effective treatments
                    while minimizing harmful side effects. To improve the effectiveness of research, researchers around the globe 
                    must collaborate in order to share information and findings.
